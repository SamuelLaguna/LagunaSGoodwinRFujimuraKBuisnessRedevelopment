- "Business Redevelopment"
- In this project we selected the website of a local business to redesign their website. We previously redesigned a website in Figma, and now we've coded that design in HTML/CSS. For the coding part of the assignment, Samuel worked on the Image Gallery page of the website, as well as the website's footer. Reed worked on the Contact Page. Kenneth worked on the Index page and the Navbar.
